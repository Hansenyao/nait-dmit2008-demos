# React Component Library - Material UI

# Why?

Design is difficult, and there's a lot of boilerplate that you don't necessarily need to build from scratch.

The MUI react is used by a whole bunch of companies that you've heard of/used their applications. You can take a look at the details 

# Steps
1. Create and Run the Next.js Project
    Create the project
    `npx create-next-app@latest components-mui-example`
    Go in to the folder
    `cd components-mui-example`
    Run the project
    `npm run dev`

2. Stop your project (ctrl+c) and install MUI using [these intructions](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- in your terminal (and the root of the project) install MUI via npm with `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
`
- If you want the roboto font you can add the Roboto font to the "Head" component of the JSX like so
```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```
Note: We're going to learn about the file `_document.js` file in next.js which adds a header to each separate page which is a more appropriate place to add this. We're going to learn about this `_document.js` and the concept of pages in this framework later in the course. 
3. Remove everything in the "main" element and we're going to take a look at how to use the MUI component library. Here is the link to the [documentation here](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/#quick-start). It's very similar to the react-bootstrap library we looked at earlier. 
- We're going to use a [Container and a Box (docs here)](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-container/) to layout our site in the index.js as follows in the JSX:
```jsx
<Container maxWidth="sm">
  <Box sx={{ my: 4 }}>
    {/* we'll add some content here.*/}
  </Box>
</Container>
````
- We're going to use [Typography (docs here)](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/#component)
```jsx
<Typography variant="h2" component="h2">
  MUI looks good.
</Typography>
<Typography variant="p" component="p">
  You can perhaps see why this is a popular package.
</Typography>         
```
- Observe the changes on the page.
- Explore the docs and see all the different types of components there are. In this course we're going to use this quite a bit, so you'll have to learn to get comfortable with navigating these docs and using it in your projects.
